The aim of FieldConstants Roo add-on is to provide simple and safe way to reference field names.

This is handy when You need to provide name of the field to some method that uses 
field name and reflection to get or set value of that field.

How this add-on works?
	When You use Spring Roo to manage Your project and have installed this plugin, then annotating 
	Your Java class with @RooFieldconstants addon will generate AspectJ ITD file. Generated ITD will add 
	static inner class called Constants to annotated Class(by using "magic" of AspectJ), that will contain 
	one String constant for each field in annotated class.

Example:
	// annotating Dog class with @RooFieldconstants...
	@RooFieldconstants
	public class Dog extends Pet {
	    private String breed;
	    // ..getter/setter omitted
	}
	// would generate file:
	privileged aspect Dog_Roo_Fieldconstants {
	    static class Dog.Constants{
	        private static final String breed = "breed";
	    }
	}
	
	// You can customize the output generated by the add-on:
	// 1) innerClassName - name of the inner class to be generated (default = "Constants")
	// 2) includeSuperClasses - should fields from ancestor classes be also included in the generated inner class.
	
	// annotating Dog class with @RooFieldconstants...
	@RooFieldconstants(innerClassName = "F", includeSuperClasses=true)
	public class Dog extends Pet {
	    private String breed;
	    // ..getter/setter omitted
	}
	public class Pet {
	    private String name;
	    private int age;
	    // ..getters/setters omitted
	}
	// would generate
	privileged aspect Dog_Roo_Fieldconstants {
	    static class Dog.F{
	        private static final String breed = "breed";
	        private static final String name = "name";
	        private static final String age = "age";
	    }
	}

Installation in roo shell:
	// install FieldConstants Roo add-on to Spring Roo
	osgi start --url file:///C:/tmp/fieldconstants-${version}.jar
	// add FieldConstants add-on dependency to project (this command will be available after project is created and until dependency is not added to the project) 
	fieldconstants setup
	// add @RooFieldconstants annotation to Dog class
	fieldconstants add --type ~.domain.Dog
	// ..or annotate all classes with the annotation
	fieldconstants all
